# NextJS + Prismic Work Examples

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to build, deploy and host the website and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) to manage content.
The features showcased here were built for clients during freelance projects I worked on.
Also included is all of the technical documentation made for clients during this time.

There you will be able to copy the desired form ID and paste it into Prismic.
